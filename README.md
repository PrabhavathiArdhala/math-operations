# math-operations
**Project Description**
The objective is to develop a Mathematical Operations Program that can perform the following tasks:
1.Calculate Factorial: Implement a function to calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer.
2.Check Prime: Implement a function to check if a given number is prime.
3.Fibonacci Sequence: Implement a function to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.
4.GCD and LCM: Implement functions to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.
**Example Usage**
./math_operations factorial 5
Factorial of 5: 120
./math_operations prime 7
7 is a prime number.
./math_operations fibonacci 10
Fibonacci sequence up to 10: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8
./math_operations gcd_lcm 12 15
GCD: 3, LCM: 60
